The MNIST dataset is common enough to the machine learning community that it comes pre-loaded with the Keras library[36]. To load this data we simply import it from the ```keras.datasets``` library. Calling ```mnist.load_data()``` returns a tuple of NumPy arrays containing a further two tuples: the first, ```(train images, train labels)```, containing $60,000$ images and their corresponding labels to be used for the process of training the network and the\n",

Using this information, we re-scale the vector so that each pixel value, $p \\in (0, 1)$. We do this rescaling to ensure the pixel values are similar in magnitude to the weights [37]. Finally, convert each of the numerical labels to categorical labels with the help of ```to_categorical``` from the ```keras.preprocessing``` package. The data is now in an appropriate form to be fed to the input layer of the neural network."
