    "In addition to this behaviour, NumPy implements a technique called broadcasting. Broadcasting refers to NumPy's ability to make sense of arithmetic involving two or more differently shaped tensors by means of cleverly duplicating the smaller array. [5]\n",

    "__Example:__ Suppose we wish to compute $(1, 2, 3)+2$. Despite the fact there is no ambiguity in how we should interpret this sum, it cannot be computed in mathematics because a vector quantity and a scalar quantity are not compatible under addition. NumPy however, will produce the expected result: $(1, 2, 3) + 2 = (3, 4, 5)$. It achieves this by broadcasting the smaller, zero-dimensional tensor, $(2)$, over the one-dimensional tensor $(1; 2; 3)$. That is, interpreting $2$ as $(2, 2, 2)$ before performing componentwise addition. The snippet of code below shows the Python implementation of this example. NumPy achieves the correct result by broadcasting whereas Python returns a ```TypeError```, meaning it cannot make sense of an addition between\n",

For example, the code snippet below demonstrates the ability of pandas to read and import data from locally stored csv files. We can also see the layout of the data using the DataFrame object.
